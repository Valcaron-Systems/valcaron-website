          Valcaron develops onboard aerial intelligence that allows drones to
          understand where things are - not just what they see.

    <!-- ===== CORE IDEA ===== -->
    <section class="l-section">
      <div class="section tech-section">

        <h2 class="section__title">Situational Awareness</h2>

        <p>
          Modern drones are widely deployed across search and rescue, security,
          and defence operations. Yet most remain passive sensors - flying cameras
          that rely on human operators to interpret raw video feeds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Valcaron's technology is designed to bridge the gap between observation
          and understanding by linking what a drone sees directly to its position
          in the world.
        </p>

    <!-- ===== HOW IT WORKS (HIGH LEVEL) ===== -->
    <section class="l-section">
      <div class="section tech-section">

        <h2 class="section__title">Spatially-Aware Aerial Survey</h2>

        <p>
          During flight, the system maintains awareness of both the aircraft’s
          motion and the environment below. As features of interest are observed,
          they can be associated with real geographic location.
        </p>

        <p>
          This allows a drone sortie to function as a structured aerial survey
          rather than an ad-hoc visual scan, producing outputs that remain useful
          beyond the moment of observation.
        </p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- ===== ONBOARD PROCESSING ===== -->
    <section class="l-section">
      <div class="section tech-section">

        <h2 class="section__title">Onboard Intelligence</h2>

        <p>
          Streaming live video places significant cognitive demand on operators
          and assumes reliable communications. In real operations, neither is
          guaranteed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Valcaron prioritises onboard processing, allowing relevant information
          to be identified and contextualised at the point of collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach is intended to reduce reliance on continuous video  
          and shift operator attention away from constant monitoring toward higher-level decision making.
        </p>

    <!-- ===== DESIGN PRINCIPLES ===== -->

      <div class="section tech-section">

        <h2 class="section__title">Design Principles</h2>

        <ul class="tech-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Actionable outputs.</strong>
            The system is designed to produce usable information, not raw data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reliability over complexity.</strong>
            Performance in real environments matters more than novelty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Modularity.</strong>
            Designed to integrate with existing aerial platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Human-centred autonomy.</strong>
            Automation exists to support human judgement, not replace it.

        <h2 class="section__title">Use Cases</h2>

        <div class="use-case">
          <h3 class="use-case-title">Search &amp; Rescue</h3>
          <p>
            In time-critical SAR operations, spatially-referenced observations
            help teams confirm coverage, revisit points of interest, and reduce
            duplicated effort.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="use-case">
          <h3 class="use-case-title">Security &amp; Emergency Response</h3>
          <p>
            Location-aware aerial surveys support perimeter monitoring, incident
            assessment, and coordinated multi-team response.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="use-case">
          <h3 class="use-case-title">Defence &amp; Military Operations</h3>
          <p>
            Improved situational awareness supports reconnaissance, planning,
            and casualty-support tasks while reducing personnel exposure.

        <h2 class="section__title">Built With Purpose</h2>

        <p>
          Valcaron’s technology is developed through careful iteration and
          real-world testing. Our goal is not novelty, but clarity - providing
          better awareness where uncertainty carries real consequences.
