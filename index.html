                        Valcaron develops advanced aerial systems that help emergency, security, and defence teams gain rapid situational awareness in 
                        challenging environments. Our technology supports faster and safer decision-making
                        during critical operations by improving the speed and accuracy of locating 
                        people, hazards, and key points of interest when time and clarity are essential.

              <p class="news-text">
                Valcaron was accepted into the Heriot-Watt University EBS Incubator in August 2025.
                The year-long programme supports early-stage technology companies through structured
                mentoring, technical development support, and access to academic and industry networks.
              </p>
              <p class="news-text">
                Participation in the incubator enables Valcaron to further develop its research-driven
                approach to onboard aerial intelligence while engaging closely with experienced founders,
                engineers, and domain specialists.

              <h4 class="news-heading">Initial concept formed during founder discussion</h4>
              <p class="news-text">
                The initial concept for Valcaron emerged during a technical discussion between co-founders
                Dean Rowlett and Reece Alexander, focused on how autonomous systems could meaningfully improve
                situational awareness in real-world environments.
              </p>
              <p class="news-text">
                That conversation highlighted a recurring gap between the volume of aerial data collected
                by drones and the limited ability of operators to interpret it quickly and reliably under
                pressure — particularly in search and rescue and security contexts.
